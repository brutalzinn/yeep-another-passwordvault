# My first try with Rust 


This project is like an airplane without engines, seats and wings.

 A small repo to give me the feelings of Rust development ( maybe i use it to Arduino development ??? YES ). The objective of this project is create a CLI tool to store passwords or other secret data using a pass secrey key with AES(Advanced Encryption Standard)
